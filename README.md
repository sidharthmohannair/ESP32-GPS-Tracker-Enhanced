## Overview

ESP32 GPS Tracker Enhanced is a professional-grade GPS tracking firmware tailored for ESP32. This firmware features advanced NMEA parsing, checksum validation, and intelligent error handling, making it a reliable solution for applications such as GPS antenna tracking, UAV navigation, and geolocation systems.

---

## Features

- **Advanced NMEA Parsing**: Efficiently processes GGA and RMC sentences for precise GPS data extraction.
- **Checksum Validation**: Ensures NMEA sentence integrity to prevent erroneous data.
- **GPS Fix Verification**: Considers satellite count, HDOP, and fix quality for accurate fixes.
- **Millis Roll-Over Management**: Prevents runtime errors in extended operations.
- **Module Reset Functionality**: Resets the GPS module automatically after prolonged inactivity.
- **Improved Error Handling**: Detects and manages timeouts, incomplete sentences, and other anomalies.
- **Flexible Time Formatting**: Outputs UTC time and date in a user-friendly format.
